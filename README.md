# Sample Savings Platform List

## Project Setup

In order to get everything up and running, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the app for ios

   ```bash
    npm run ios
   ```
4. Start the app for android

   ```bash
    npm run android
   ```

## The Task

Fix as many issues as you can in the app. The app is a sample savings platform list, and has a number of issues that need to be resolved. The issues are both functional and non-functional, and range from accessibility to performance.

### Out of scope (you can assume these things are ok)

- How the build / typescript / prettier is configured

### Requirements

The requirements for the final application are given below. For each one, can you find an example of where the requirement has been met, and an example of where it hasn't?

- TypeScript should be used to ensure data integrity.
- Basic accessibility standards should be met. (e.g. color contrast, text size, touch targets)
- The UI should display within the screen.
- There are an excessive number of re-renders of the List items. How can we reduce this? To note, we purposely poll data every 5 seconds to simulate a real world scenario, so the list will update frequently.

### Additionally

- We want to show the bank details on a separate screen, what would be the best way to get this information and display it on the page?

### Finally

What other problems / opportunities for improvement can you spot?
Remember that we will be doing a live code review session, and we might ask you to implement something minor during that session.

We wish you the best of luck!
Happy coding!
